## Development

Here's how to work on the project, if you want to contribute.

### Building from source

To build the latest version of the client from source, clone this repository and
run, with [Rust](https://rust-lang.com/) installed:

```
cargo install --path crates/sshx
```

This will compile the `sshx` binary and place it in your `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

### Workflow

Install [Rust 1.70+](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[Node v18](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM v9](https://www.npmjs.com/), and
[mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs). Then, run

```shell
$ npm install
$ mprocs
```

This will compile and start the server, an instance of the client, and the web
frontend in parallel on your machine.

## Deployment

The application server is containerized, and its latest version is automatically
deployed on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

```shell
fly deploy
```
